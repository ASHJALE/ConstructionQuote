Construction Quote Web Application

The Construction Quote Web Application is a Django-based solution designed to simplify and automate the process of generating and managing quotations for construction projects. Created specifically for construction companies, this application allows users to create project plans, calculate costs dynamically, and track updates in real-time. The app provides distinct user roles for administrators and clients, each with tailored access to ensure efficient management and transparent communication throughout the project lifecycle.


Features

This application offers a range of features that streamline the quotation and project management process. Admins can access a comprehensive dashboard to manage project quotations, update costs, and monitor project statuses. The app’s role-based redirection feature ensures that admins and regular users are directed to the appropriate dashboards upon logging in, creating a seamless experience for both client management and project tracking. AJAX-driven real-time updates allow both parties to see instant cost adjustments, which are essential for managing construction projects where material prices and labor costs fluctuate. The front end is built with Bootstrap, providing a responsive and user-friendly design that works across devices.


Tech Stack

The application is built with Django, leveraging Django REST Framework to facilitate RESTful API interactions. The front end uses Bootstrap and AJAX for a responsive, dynamic experience, while the database setup includes SQLite for local development, with PostgreSQL recommended for production deployments. Version control is managed through Git, and the project repository is hosted on GitHub, allowing for easy collaboration and deployment.


Installation

To run the Construction Quote Web Application locally, start by cloning the repository from GitHub. Next, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies, and install the required packages from the requirements.txt file. Configure environment variables in a .env file, including the Django secret key and database settings. Run database migrations to set up the initial schema, and create a superuser account for admin access. Once the setup is complete, you can start the Django development server and access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.


Usage

The application is designed to be user-friendly for both administrators and clients. Admins can log in to manage all aspects of project quotations, including creating, updating, and approving quotes. They can also view real-time cost adjustments and track project progress. Regular users, on the other hand, can register to submit project requests, view quotation details, and monitor updates on the status and costs of their projects. The interface’s simplicity allows for easy navigation, with real-time AJAX updates enhancing transparency and ensuring all stakeholders have access to the latest project information.


Project Structure

The application’s structure includes a main Django app for core functionality, encompassing views, models, and templates for handling project quotation tasks. HTML templates are stored in the templates folder and are styled with Bootstrap to provide a responsive interface. Static files, including CSS, JavaScript, and images, are organized in the static folder, while any uploaded documents are stored in the media directory. The requirements.txt file lists all necessary dependencies, ensuring that setting up the project environment is straightforward.
